Python Web-Scraping

This repository is my Python web scraping files. I use BeautifulSoup4 (bs4) for all my scraping projects since it is easier and cleaner than 
using regular expressions. I  use "Html Requests" to get the web page content and then create a "soup" object from there with bs4.

Installing BeautifulSoup4

Using pip

pip install beautifulsoup4
Using easy_install

easy_install beautifulsoup4

import Panda and numpy
Trying to parse the elements.
parsing paragraphs and links
using get_and_parse remove the unwanted data and extract the visible text.
using sentiment_detection and topic_detection find the topic.
print the topics in dictionary
using panda frame we can find Paragraphs and Topics
then finding Paragraphs elements.
using lamda finding paragraphs elements and paragraphs text.
trying to find the character count.

lastly using import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plot my topics and sentiment we got histogram and bar chart to analylize how topics related with sentiment.
